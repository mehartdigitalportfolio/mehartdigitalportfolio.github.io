       <h2> 
    Strength: 
    </h2>
      <p>
       In the beginning of the year, my strength was my ability to listen to others with respect and without completely ignoring what they said for my own benefit, especially in group projects. My strength has remained constant, I definitely am still always making sure everyone is heard in group projects. For example, in the Anti-Federalist vs Federalist debate, I made sure that each person on my team was heard and had a different "topic" to talk about.    
      </p>
      <h2> 
    Stretch/SMART Goal:
      </h2>
      <p>
       My stretch in the beginning of the year was just planning in general. In essays, I had trouble dividing my time and on projects, I had trouble deciding whether I write too much or too little. Now I have started using the right thinking maps on my essays, and essays aren't as difficult as they were before.
