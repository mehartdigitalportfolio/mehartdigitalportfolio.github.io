          <h3>
          Scarlet Letter Essay
          </h3>
          <p>
          This artifact greatly reflects my SMART goal. In the process of this essay, I focused on organizing my time and thoughts. I used a detailed, organized thinking map that was made up of the annotations that I took from the Scarlett Letter. This represents my strength because in order to annotate, I have to listen to the symbolic meanings that the teacher says is hidden in the text. This process produces quality projects.
